The for Loop

for loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python. 
Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over strings, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.
  we can use loops for lists, sets and dictionaries

range():
What if we do not want to iterate over a sequence? What if we want to use for loop for a specific number of times?
Here, we can use the range() function.

Explore about third parameter of range (ie range(x, y, z))

for in range(1,30,2):
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
21
23
25
27
29

the third parameter in the for loop is for skipping the number of digits from the sequence of the numbers



name = 'Abhishek'
for i in name:
  print(i)
  if(i =="b"):
    print("This is something special!")

Output ::
A
b
This is something special!
h
i
s
h
e
k



colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"]
for color in colors:
  print(color)
  for i in color:
    print(i)


output ::
Red
R
e
d
Green
G
r
e
e
n
Blue
B
l
u
e
Yellow
Y
e
l
l
o
w



for k in range(5):
  print(k + 1)

output ::

1
2
3
4
5
