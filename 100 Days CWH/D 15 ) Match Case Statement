A match statement will compare a given variableâ€™s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern.
The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.

The match case consists of three main entities :

1 . The match keyword
2 . One or more case clauses
3 . Expression for each case
The case clause consists of a pattern to be matched to the variable, a condition to be evaluated if the pattern matches,
and a set of statements to be executed if the pattern matches.




x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
# x is the variable to match
match x:
    # if x is 0
    case 0:
        print("x is zero")
    # case with if-condition
    case 4:
        print("case is 4")

    case _ if x<=90:
        print(x, "is <= 90")
    case _ if x<=100:
        print(x, "is greater than 90 & less than 100")
    case _:
        print(x , "is greater than 100!!!!!")



Output ::

Enter the value of x: 101
101 is greater than 100!!!!!

Enter the value of x: 12
12 is <= 90

Enter the value of x: -123
-123 is <= 90

Enter the value of x: 0
x is zero

Enter the value of x: 4
case is 4
